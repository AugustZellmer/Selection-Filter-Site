			<p>Selection Filter is a simple addon for Google Sheets which allows you to filter out rows and columns based on the
				contents of their cells. This is accomplished by simply hiding the rows/columns which do not contain specific
				values that you specify.</p>
			<p>Google Sheets already has the functionality to filter data. However, this plugin was born out of the need to filter
				data in slightly more advanced ways than Google Sheets natively allows. The filtering functionality provided by
				Google Sheets only allows you to filter out rows based on the values in a column. Selection Filter does this, and
				also allows you to filter out <em>columns</em> based on the values in a <em>row</em>. Furthermore, the filter in Google Sheets acts
				upon the entire spreadsheet; if you filter the value "100" out of column B, then every row which contains the value
				"100" in column B will be hidden. Selection Filter allows you to filter data <em>in a specific range</em>; it is possible,
				for example, to filter out each row <em>between rows 2 and 5</em> that contains the value "100" in column B, while leaving
				rows 6 and on untouched. Please see the screenshots for more concrete examples of the filtering functionality
				provided by Selection Filter.</p>
			<h3 id="privacyPolicy" class="hashLink">Privacy Policy</h3>
			<p>Selection Filter must be granted permission to read that data on your spreadsheets. This data read is only used to
				help you setup filters on your spreadsheets; Selection Filter will not upload your data to any additional servers
				(besides the Google servers which it is already stored on), nor will Selection Filter share your data with anyone.
				Selection Filter must also be granted permission to hide the rows/columns on your spreadsheet. Hiding these rows/columns
				is how Selection Filter will filter your data. Selection Filter will not edit any of the cells on your spreadsheets.</p>
			<p>I (August Zellmer) am provided with basic information about how frequently Selection Filter is used. I may share this
				usage data with others (e.g. friends, potential employers, etc.). I will not sell this usage data.</p>
